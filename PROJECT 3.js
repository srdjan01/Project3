// PROJECT 3

// 1080 Training

// An app that allows users who have busy schedules to “find” a personal trainer in their area at any time who are willing to come and meet them and train them. Its basically uber for personal trainers. If a trainer has a slow day and wants to work, can turn on their app and wait for a user who is close enough and meet them at their gym to train for a set fee.

// We feel this is a valuable app because there is nothing really like it on the market, and it takes out the middle man of going thru a gym to find a trainer. It is straight customer to service provider reaction. 


// screen 1- home screen that requires a user to log in, and then answer some simple questions for the type of workout that they want, the time, and their location.

// screen 2- when there is a match, a picture and information of their trainer will pop up and also which gym they will be going to if not specified beforehand 

// Screen 3- home screen but for trainers who have separate login requirements, simple form for trainer to enter personal information and quick details about them

// screen 4- an option for trainers to accept a “ping” when a customer enters that he wants to train

// Both logins will require their position to be found/tracked

// app will act similar to uber 

// will need google api’s/paypal
// mongoose DB
// full CRUD for forms. “pings”
// Encrypt for logins
